## VibeFit

**Skills Portrayed:** HTML/CSS, JS, NodeJS, JSON, Python, Image Processing, Flutter, Machine Learning.

It’s a profile-based web app designed mainly for the Govt. of India for keeping a track on the life expectancy and overall health so that they can make and implement policies based on that data. This web app is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Node.JS in the backend. We have created a database using MySQL for storing the user’s information and login credentials.

We are using machine learning on an organic dataset compiled over different demographic and working days to analyse and set the average life expectancy of a person living in India. Day to day activities will show the variation in real time. This data will be collected by the user’s health app which will be unique to every person based on internal or external factors which may include the environment and/or person’s physical fitness. With the use of TensorFlow Lite, the model would be easily available on a mobile device for prediction as web-based portal has become cliché by the hands of youngsters and young adults

Our system also consists of a mobile app that helps that will give the users a personalized record and predicted lifespan based on their lifestyle. A TensorFlow model in the app itself predicts the life expectancy of the person based on calorie intake, sleeping habits recorded from mobile usage, physical activity, working hours involved and other data gathered from the Fitbit. The app also compares your lifestyle to a lifestyle of higher life expectancy and also the national average. The user can also give manual inputs such as chronic diseases and medications taken. This data collected from individual users form the basis for the cumulative data shown on the government portal. 

### Future Scope: Some future scopes of VibeFit are as follows:
1. On device integration of life expectancy on smart wearables: Users will be able to get an estimation of their life expectancy on their wrist-bands.
2. Govt integration with the data to provide better healthcare and gym facilities: Using the data collected by our model, Government can frame their policies suited best for the health care of their people.
3. Profile sharing with emergency contacts: In case of any emergency, users can send a distress call along with their location to the contacts listed under emergency contacts.
4. Release of open source SDK to develop as per community: Release of SDK for open source development of the app for future modifications by the community and easy deployment on any device.
5. Bridging the gap between doctor and population: This can make being healthy a lot more hassle free because now the user knows exactly what they have to do to live a longer life and can coordinate with their doctors accordingly, thus making the job of both parties a lot easier than ever!
